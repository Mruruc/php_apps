# Project Summary

This project is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) implementation for web development. It aims to provide a structured and organized approach to building web applications. The MVC architecture separates the application into three main components: the model, which represents the data and business logic, the view, which handles the presentation and user interface, and the controller, which manages the communication between the model and the view.

By following the MVC pattern, this project promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability. It allows developers to easily modify or extend specific components without affecting the entire application. Additionally, the project utilizes XAMPP, a popular web server solution, to provide a local development environment.

To get started with this project, refer to the installation instructions and documentation provided in this repository. Happy coding!
